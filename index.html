            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Yoonhee Kim. I have a bachelor’s and master’s degree in information and industrial engineering with a concentration in optimization. Based on my academic background, Samsung hired me as a data management analysist. During my career I learned how manage and optimize the conveyer system within the semiconductor plant using SQL and JAVA.</p>
            <p>I’ve always enjoyed thinking critically and solving problems, thus, having the opportunity to learn and implement web-based language and simultaneously experiencing of my code being actualized in real-life is both interesting and exciting. It is my desire to become an avid supporter and expert of web-based language.</p>
